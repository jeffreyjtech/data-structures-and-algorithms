# Hashmap LEFT JOIN

The goal for the code challenge was to implement a simplified LEFT JOIN for 2 Hashmaps.

## Challenge

Write a function called left join

- Arguments: two hash maps
  - The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
  - The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
- Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesnâ€™t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic
