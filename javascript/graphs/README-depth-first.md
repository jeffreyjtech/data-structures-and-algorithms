# Depth First Traversal

Create a method which performs a depth first traversal on a graph, returning the furthest vertices first.

## Challenge

Write the following method for the Graph class:

- Name: Depth first
- Arguments: Node (Starting point of search)
- Return: A collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order
- Program output: Display the collection
