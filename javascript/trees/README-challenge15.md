# Trees

Trees are a elementary data structure which stores data in linked nodes. The nodes contain a value and a set number of references to other nodes. A tree with nodes containing two references is a Binary Tree. Binary Trees are useful for their ability to store and retrieve sorted data very efficiently.

## Challenge

In this Code Challenge, I had to implement the following classes and methods:

- Binary Tree class
  - with a method for each subtype of depth-first traversals, which return an array of the values, ordered appropriately:
    - `preOrder()`
    - `inOrder()`
    - `postOrder()`
- Binary Search Tree class
  - with `add()` method
    - Arguments: `value`
    - Return: nothing
    - Adds a new node with that `value` in the correct location in the binary search tree.
  - with `contains()` method
    - Argument: `value`
    - Returns: `Boolean` indicating whether or not the `value` is in the tree at least once.
